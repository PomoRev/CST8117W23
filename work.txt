any time you change a number display the new number

existing number  = 0 (initialized)

if I press a number

    existing number = (existing number X 10) + number

    display the existing number


if I press an operator or an =

    if there is an operator stored

        if it is a +
            old number = existing number + old number

        if it is a - 
            old number = old number - existing number

        if it is a /
            old number =  old number / existing number

        if it is a *
            old number = existing number * old number

        existing number = 0
        display the old number
        
        
    put the operator (+,-,/,X) in existing operator

    if operator is =

        clear out the operator
        clear out the old number

    if operator is CLEAR 

        set old number and existing number to 0
        set clear the operator

        display existing number
