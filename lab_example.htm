        hello.
    
    <p class="bodytext">
        The shades were closed keeping the room dark.
        Peter knew that he should open them and let in the
        sunlight so he could begin the day, but he didn't
        have the energy or willpower. Nothing had gone as
        expected the day before and he no longer wanted to
        spend the energy to begin a new day. He stared at
        the shades wondering if there was a way to disappear
        from the reality of the world for the rest of the day.

        Two hikers had started the day to sunny weather without a
        cloud in the sky, but they hadn't thought to check the<br>
        weather north of the canyon. Huge thunderstorms had brought
        a deluge o rain and produced flash floods heading their way.
        The two hikers had no idea what was coming.

        It all started with a random letter. Several of those
        were joined forces to create a random word. The words
        decided to get together and form a random sentence. They
        decided not to stop there and it wasn't long before a
        random paragraph had been cobbled together. The question
        was whether or not they could continue the momentum long
        enough to create a random short story.
